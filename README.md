# Hypertube

Hypertube is a library for the creation and usage of TUN devices.
Hypertube is meant to be a replacement for [tun](https://crates.io/crates/tun) that aims to improve the cli and allow for writing to and reading from multiple queues at the same time.

### Hypertube is not a perfect replacement for tun
Hypertube is not currently cross-platform, but I plan for it to be in the future.
